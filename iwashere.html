            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enigma is the student union for Clermont-Ferrand's colleges of mathematics and computer science.<br>
            I am the creator and the current maintener of our website: <a href="https://bdeenigma.fr/"><b>Visit it</b></a><br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being part of Enigma has provided me with experience as a staff member during our events. I also played a major role in designing an event that will take place in January 2024: 
            a <i>Scratch Competition</i>. It will be a sort of game jam, where competitors have to code in the educational programming language Scratch.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FedEA stands for Auvergne Students' Federation. Its aim is to improve students' quality of life through every posisble method.<br>
            It offers a wide variety of training courses for community-involved students on subjects like election tactics or reading budget documents.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the students voted for their representatives in the highest councils of the University, the FedEA coordinated a crew of candidates, and I was one of them.<br>
            We were elected by a large majority, and I am honoured to embody the students' voices in the board of directors.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GaZZette is the name given to Isima's newspaper. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of its goals is to keep the students aware of the school's news : club events, course presentations, interview of alumnis, etc. 
            It also covers <i>Tech news</i>, or important events happening in our city. 
            Finally, there are sections dealing with the arts! <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I joined the GaZZette as redactor of the cinema section. 
            I wanted to contribute more to the newspaper, and in January 2024, it will be my first edition as editor-in-chief! <br>
            You can find more about the articles I wrote on <a href="./articles.html"><b>this page</b></a> ;)

            <a href="https://clermont-filmfest.org/en/global/home/"><b>Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival</b></a> 
            (Clermont ISFF) is the most important film festival dedicated to short films in the world.
            With its 160,000 visitors each year, it is the second largest film festival in France, just after Cannes.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cinema-lover living in the city, it would have been a shame to pass up such an opportunity! I volunteered in the 2023 edition, and I'll do it again in 2024.<br>
            I belong to the <i>Backup crew</i>, whose mission is to help other volunteers when they are overwhelmed, and to improvise solutions to unforeseen situations.<br>
            Meeting movie directors from all over the world and experiencing the festival's atmosphere from the inside is a wonderful experience!

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From June 2022 to August 2023, I had a part-tim job as receptionist at the 
            <a href="https://www.crous-clermont.fr/logement/residence-philippe-lebon-2/"><b>hall of residence Philippe Lebon</b></a>.<br>
            My role was mainly to help and inform the residents in their daily lives.
            I answered their questions about the residence or the city, provided access to the residence's services, dealt with lost keys, and so on. I was also the switchboard operator.
            When I worked alone (during the week-ends and late evenings), I was responsible for the security of the building.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad I experiencd a more professional setting during my studies, and improved soft-skills that will be appreciated in any occupation.
