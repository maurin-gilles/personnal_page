            It is a group of regional mutual banks, including Centre France, which mainly covers the Auvergne region, where I worked as knowledge manager during the summer 2024.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main tasks were to help update a the chatbot, roll out an internal ticketing system, and create a harmonised documentation library on a new SharePoint application. 
            Most of the tools I used were specific to the company, but I also improved a lot my skills in Excel, and particularly VBA.

            My role was mainly to help and inform the residents in their daily lives.
            I answered their questions about the residence or the city, provided access to the residence's services, dealt with lost keys, and so on. I was also the switchboard operator.
            When I worked alone (during the week-ends and late evenings), I was responsible for the security of the building.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad I experiencd a more professional setting during my studies, and improved soft-skills that will be appreciated in any occupation.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of its goals is to keep the students aware of the school's news : club events, course presentations, interview of alumnis, etc. 
            It also covers <i>Tech news</i>, or important events happening in Clermont-Ferrand.
            Finally, there are sections dealing with the arts! <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I joined the GaZZette as redactor of the cinema section. 
            Since February 2024, I am also the editor-in-chief! <br>
            My role is now to lead the crew, write the main articles, do the interviews, and to do all the work that doesn't consist in writing.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FedEA stands for Auvergne Students' Federation. Its aim is to improve students' quality of life through every possible method.<br>
            It offers a wide variety of training courses for community-involved students on subjects like election tactics or reading budget documents.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the students voted for their representatives in the highest councils of the University, the FedEA coordinated a crew of candidates, and I was one of them.<br>
            We were elected by a large majority, and I am honoured to embody the students' voices in the board of directors.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our achievements is the submission of a motion for menstrual leaves in the university, which has been approved.

            <br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being part of Enigma has provided me with experience as a staff member during our events. I also helpened designing some events.
            This is a great way to get used to teamworking as a student, and together, we have been through a few crisis that have made us grow!

            who wanted to share his passion for history.
            I joined him to lead the Geography side of the club. Other people joined too, interested in Mythology, Fantasy World Lores and Alternate History.
            As for me, I also became secretary.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this club, I have organized a GeoGuessr tournament, and an event about vexillology and heraldry.

            With its 160,000 visitors each year, it is the second largest film festival in France, just after Cannes.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cinema-lover living in the city, it would have been a shame to pass up such an opportunity! I volunteered in the 2023, 2024 abd 2025 editions.<br>
            I belong to the <i>Backup crew</i>, whose mission is to help other volunteers when they are overwhelmed, and to improvise solutions to unforeseen situations.<br>
            Meeting movie directors from all over the world and experiencing the festival's atmosphere from the inside is a wonderful experience!
